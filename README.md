- Where do we start, model building wise?

```
Remember to make a baseline model (mean) before attempting to build something more advanced (multi-layered-perceptron/layered-MLP: ResNet, LTST, GPT, etc.)! Example: in MNIST, the baseline would be a model that is trained to recognise the average of pixels in a training set.

What is a predictive model in the Deep Learning world which is viable investment wise, and ethically?

- User must opt into the data extraction happily: this means they should benefit from the data analytics that they are producting data for. The economy should be a two way non-extractive system. Or at the very least, mutually extractive. 

- The data flow should be continuous. This means that the source of the data should have a long-term investment in the program that collects the data; be that emotionally, fincancially, socially or otherwise. The source and the anaytic models should communicate effectively. The data should feed into the model, the model should provide value, the source should be compensated, and then provide more data happily knowing that they will benefit from the process as it continues.

- In order to cut out the advertising agents and avoid further collapse of civilisation, the data should be hidden. The problem here is that: how can a user trust that the computer is providing the correct work on their data? The future of this process will likely involve ZKP, where we can verify that a calculation is done fairly without any trust or revealing the data itself. This allows for a truly tustless and anonymous economic system where real work is rewarded and malicious actors are destroyed.

The problem: the datasets for patient success in an offical capacity for psylocybe treatment are too small for systematic change
Question: How can we provide systematic evidence for or against the adpotion of psylocybe treatment for mental health diseases in a way that:

  - does not discredit the academics researching 

  - that is safe for the patients 

  - is data heavy enough to provide reasonable argumentation to bring in experts from other cultures to provide further support in treatment conditions, and not be questioned in doing so by the powers that be
